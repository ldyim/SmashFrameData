This page can help you if you are having trouble with the app.


# FAQ

### How do I see frame by frame? 
You can see this by tapping on the hitbox you would like to see. 

### Why don't some moves have hitboxes? 
Currently, the hitboxes are not available. I will try and update the app as more are created.

### Why is the app so big?
The focus of the app was to provide a convenient resource players can use even without access to the internet. Future updates are planned to reduce the app file size. 

### What do all the numbers around the hitboxes mean? 
There is a detailed explanation in the help section of the app. This can be accessed by tapping the question mark on the home screen.
